December imports fell overall, but analysts say the decline came from Reliance, not PSU refiners (IOC, BPCL): signaling demand reshuffling, not collapse.</p>\n<p>🔍 STOCK SPOTLIGHT\nSanDisk (Memory) +27.6%\nNvidia’s Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 that memory is a massive “unserved market” as AI demand accelerates. SanDisk’s NAND flash storage positions it as a key beneficiary of AI-driven memory optimisation spend; stock is now up 871% since Feb 2025.</p>\n<p>Next (Clothing Retailer) +3.6%\nRaised its 2026 profit outlook after strong Christmas demand, reporting 10.6% sales growth and a 38.3% jump in international revenue.</p>\n<p>📘 Term of the Day: Price Taker vs Price Maker\nA price maker can set prices due to strong demand or dominance (like Nvidia in AI chips), while a price taker must accept market prices, as seen in commodities or airlines; price makers typically earn higher valuations thanks to stronger, more stable margins.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: Educational purposes only.
